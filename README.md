## Contributing

**Please do all work inside feature branches, and subsequently open a PR.**

### Submitting posts

1. Make a new markdown (`.md`) file in `_posts` following the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-some-title.md`

2. Blog to your heart's content. Spell check, and test your build locally with `jekyll serve`.

3. Ensure your front matter at the beginning of the file looks like:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your title"
date: 2017-07-29 15:57:30 -0500
author: name
---
```

> **Note:** If you're a new member of the blog, be sure you have an author entry in our `_config.yml`.

### Updating Jekyll theme, adding new pages, etc.

- Please discuss these in the Discord beforehand before putting the time into the blog frontend (since this affects everyone)
- If you can, throw up your own host so we can check it out. Otherwise provide screenshots, etc.
- Test the layout as best you can ensuring existing posts render correctly, especially if your addition relies on newly required front matter to render correctly.
