It's the end of another year. Here, I reflect on how this year was one of the
craziest years of my life so far, and share with how proud I am of everyone
in our little rag-tag Y32 community.

## We've grown as programmers.

At the time of writing, the Y32 team has 2,444 contributions publicly listed
on our profiles. While this may not seem like a whole lot, between these
commits, we solved problems together. We answered each other's questions.
We trolled the hell out of each other.

I'm confident that everyone can look back upon these past months and say that
they've learned something. I'm confident that everyone here can think of the
programmer that they were a year ago and see that they've summited hills, even
mountains, of tasks, knowledge, and challenges they once stood at the foot of.

We've also said "fuck" a lot.

As programmers - as problem solvers - we naturally spend a lot of our time
being frustrated. We're constantly frustrated and challenged by things we
don't understand, but that's also part of what defines us.

This frustration is what pulls us forward and tempers us from the natural drive
we have to improve ourselves. The drive to make something great. To make
something we can all celebrate - *you* made a thing! No matter how small, that's
something to be proud of, because you did it. You challenged yourself and won.

Never undervalue even the smallest victory.

## We've grown as people.

The guild has been around for a little more than a year now. Some people have
come and gone, but that's okay. I guarantee that everyone of our members at
some point have participated in our conversations and laughed, smiled. That's
a victory to me, and the most I can hope for.

Then there are those of you who go above and beyond. I am constantly humbled
by those of you who take your time to ask questions, and those of you who
take your time to answer them. You all clearly respect and value the experience
of your friends here. That's amazing to me, and you should all be proud of
yourselves for that.

And even still, some of us have made personal connections with your friends in
the guild here. We play games together. We slide in each others DMs, and we
help each other overcome the curve balls our lives have thrown us, or even just
provide each other company to endure. We genuinely care for each other and
that's something really special. I know for me personally, I wouldn't be who I
am today in some way had I not met some of you. For better, I hope some of you
can say the same - or for worse, I hope you can realize that you've still grown
as a person from your experiences together.

And for that I thank you.

## 2018 - Forward.

Next year is going to be a huge year for me, personally. I'm trying to take the
next step in my career. At the end of 2018 I plan on moving to another state so
I can live closer to my best friends. And I'm going to be writing a lot of code,
asking a lot of questions, and hopefully answering them too. It's going to be
tough.

I hope you'll be here with me as you've been for the past year. If only to
share memes, and make each other laugh. But I hope you'll continue to help each
other too, as programmers, and as people - friends. I know I'm going to need
your help.

I can only imagine how much frustration 2018 will bring. I can only
imagine how many challenges we'll overcome, how much we will learn. And I can
only imagine how much we'll grow, forward, together.
