[Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org) is a pre-made configuration for GNU editor Emacs. It combines the superior editing of vim and the extensibility of emacs into one thing,as well as premade configs for many languages.

Installing Emacs
===================

Depending on your operating system, installing emacs should be quite effortless. On arch linux it's as simple as
```
sudo pacman -S emacs
```
