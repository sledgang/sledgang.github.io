### What is CSS Grids?
CSS Grids is a new standard in CSS3 and is slowly being adopted by all web browsers.
Creating a basic website layout requires more than a few lines of CSS, for example:
```css
.wrap {
    border: 5px solid red;
    height: 400px;
}

.main-content {
    width: 45%;
    margin-left: 1%;
    height: 98%;
    float: left;
    background-color: aqua;
}

.sidebar {
    width: 45%;
    margin-right: 1%;
    height: 98%;
    float: right;
    background-color: crimson;
}
```

Grid creates, well, a grid inside a div element. We can decide how many rows and columns we create as well as the gaps between them.
After this any child elements (we cant place any child of child elements, that would be too inception-y) can be formed to fit inside this grid, which eliminates thinking about how to design a site using dozens of wrappers and placing elements inside boxes inside boxes.

```css
.wrap {
    border: 5px solid red;
    height: 400px;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 100%;
    grid-gap: 10px;
}

.main-content {
    margin-left: 1%;
    grid-area: 0/1;
    height: 98%;
    background-color: aqua;
}

.sidebar {
    margin-right: 1%;
    grid-area: 1/2;
    height: 98%;
    background-color: crimson;
}

```
This does the same thing, what we are doing is making a grid with 2 columns and one row, then setting the columns size to `1fr` which is 1 fraction of the available space

The Grids example above looks quite ugly as you can imagine working with column and row numbers in `grid-area` will get complex with even a few of each, so next we can look at naming the layout sections for ease of use. Below is a mockup site made with `grid-template-areas`

And the CSS:
```css
:root {
  --grid-gap: 5px;
  --font-size: 1em;
}
p {
  font-size: var(--font-size);
  display: inline-block;
}

#wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 4fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 4em 12em auto 4em;
  grid-template-areas:
  "nav nav nav"
  "hd hd hd"
  "side cnt cnt"
  ". ft ft";
  grid-gap: var(--grid-gap);
  height: 100%;
}

.header {
  background-color: blue;
  grid-area: hd;
  margin: 0 0 0 0;
}

.sidebar {
  background-color: pink;
  grid-area: side;
}

.navbar {
  background-color: skyblue;
  grid-area: nav;
  --font-size: 1.5em;
}

.content {
  background-color: yellow;
  grid-area: cnt;
}

.footer {
  background-color: grey;
  grid-area: ft;
}

```
Using `grid-tempate-areas` we write down for each column and row, you can do it all on one line but how its down above feels nicer for me. After this we use `grid-area` and instead of the grid numbers we just use the grid area "name" (the "." here is an example of blank) 

From looking at the below image, CSS Grids has only recently gained support in non-microsoft browsers (they dont even have proper support yet) so only users with up to date browsers will be able to properly see your website. If you want to start building a CSS Grids website now you can put it all inside a `@supports (display: grid) {}`
